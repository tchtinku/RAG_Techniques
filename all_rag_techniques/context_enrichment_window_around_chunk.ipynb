    "### Context Enrichment Window for Document Retrieval\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "###### This code implements a context enrichment window technique for document retrieval in a vector database. It enhances the standard retrieval process by adding surrounding context to each retrieved chunk, improving the coherence and completeness of the returned information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "###### Traditional vector search often returns isolated chunks of text, which may lack necessary context for full understanding. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive view of the retrieved information by including neighboring text chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components\n",
    "###### PDF processing and text chunking\n",
    "###### Vector store creation using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings\n",
    "###### Custom retrieval function with context window\n",
    "###### Comparison between standard and context-enriched retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method Details\n",
    "##### Document Preprocessing\n",
    "###### The PDF is read and converted to a string.\n",
    "###### The text is split into chunks with overlap, each chunk tagged with its index.\n",
    "##### Vector Store Creation\n",
    "###### OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the chunks.\n",
    "###### A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings.\n",
    "##### Context-Enriched Retrieval\n",
    "###### The retrieve_with_context_overlap function performs the following steps:\n",
    "###### Retrieves relevant chunks based on the query\n",
    "###### For each relevant chunk, fetches neighboring chunks\n",
    "###### Concatenates the chunks, accounting for overlap\n",
    "###### Returns the expanded context for each relevant chunk\n",
    "#### Retrieval Comparison\n",
    "###### The notebook includes a section to compare standard retrieval with the context-enriched approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of this Approach\n",
    "###### Provides more coherent and contextually rich results\n",
    "###### Maintains the advantages of vector search while mitigating its tendency to return isolated text fragments\n",
    "###### Allows for flexible adjustment of the context window size\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "###### This context enrichment window technique offers a promising way to improve the quality of retrieved information in vector-based document search systems. By providing surrounding context, it helps maintain the coherence and completeness of the retrieved information, potentially leading to better understanding and more accurate responses in downstream tasks such as question answering.\n",

    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a rich history dating back to the mid-20th century. The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was coined in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, marking the field's official beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1950s and 1960s, AI research focused on symbolic methods and problem-solving. The Logic Theorist, created in 1955 by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, is often considered the first AI program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1960s saw the development of expert systems, which used predefined rules to solve complex problems. DENDRAL, created in 1965, was one of the first expert systems, designed to analyze chemical compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the 1970s brought the first \"AI Winter,\" a period of reduced funding and interest in AI research, largely due to overpromised capabilities and underdelivered results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1980s saw a resurgence with the popularization of expert systems in corporations. The Japanese government's Fifth Generation Computer Project also spurred increased investment in AI research globally.\n",

    "Deep Learning, a subset of machine learning using neural networks with many layers, began to show promising results in the early 2010s. The breakthrough came in 2012 when a deep neural network significantly outperformed other machine learning methods in the ImageNet competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, deep learning has revolutionized many AI applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. In 2016, Google's AlphaGo defeated a world champion Go player, a landmark achievement in AI.\n",
