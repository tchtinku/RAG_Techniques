    "### Document Augmentation through Question Generation for Enhanced Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "###### This implementation demonstrates a text augmentation technique that leverages additional question generation to improve document retrieval within a vector database. By generating and incorporating various questions related to each text fragment, the system enhances the standard retrieval process, thus increasing the likelihood of finding relevant documents that can be utilized as context for generative question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "###### By enriching text fragments with related questions, we aim to significantly enhance the accuracy of identifying the most relevant sections of a document that contain answers to user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "###### This approach utilizes OpenAI's language models and embeddings. You'll need an OpenAI API key to use this implementation. Make sure you have the required Python packages installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "##   pip install langchain openai faiss-cpu PyPDF2 pydantic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "###### PDF Processing and Text Chunking: Handling PDF documents and dividing them into manageable text fragments.\n",
    "###### Question Augmentation: Generating relevant questions at both the document and fragment levels using OpenAI's language models.\n",
    "###### Vector Store Creation: Calculating embeddings for documents using OpenAI's embedding model and creating a FAISS vector store.\n",
    "###### Retrieval and Answer Generation: Finding the most relevant document using FAISS and generating answers based on the context provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Document Preprocessing\n",
    "###### Convert the PDF to a string using PyPDFLoader from LangChain.\n",
    "###### Split the text into overlapping text documents (text_document) for building context purpose and then each document to overlapping text fragments (text_fragment) for retrieval and semantic search purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Document Augmentation\n",
    "###### Generate questions at the document or text fragment level using OpenAI's language models.\n",
    "###### Configure the number of questions to generate using the QUESTIONS_PER_DOCUMENT constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Vector Store Creation\n",
    "###### Use the OpenAIEmbeddings class to compute document embeddings.\n",
    "###### Create a FAISS vector store from these embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Retrieval and Generation\n",
    "###### Retrieve the most relevant document from the FAISS store based on the given query.\n",
    "###### Use the retrieved document as context for generating answers with OpenAI's language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of This Approach\n",
    "###### Enhanced Retrieval Process: Increases the probability of finding the most relevant FAISS document for a given query.\n",
    "###### Flexible Context Adjustment: Allows for easy adjustment of the context window size for both text documents and fragments.\n",
    "###### High-Quality Language Understanding: Leverages OpenAI's powerful language models for question generation and answer production.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation Details\n",
    "###### The OpenAIEmbeddingsWrapper class provides a consistent interface for embedding generation.\n",
    "###### The generate_questions function uses OpenAI's chat models to create relevant questions from the text.\n",
    "###### The process_documents function handles the core logic of document splitting, question generation, and vector store creation.\n",
    "###### The main execution demonstrates loading a PDF, processing its content, and performing a sample query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "###### This technique provides a method to improve the quality of information retrieval in vector-based document search systems. By generating additional questions similar to user queries and utilizing OpenAI's advanced language models, it potentially leads to better comprehension and more accurate responses in subsequent tasks, such as question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Note on API Usage\n",
    "###### Be aware that this implementation uses OpenAI's API, which may incur costs based on usage. Make sure to monitor your API usage and set appropriate limits in your OpenAI account settings.\n",
