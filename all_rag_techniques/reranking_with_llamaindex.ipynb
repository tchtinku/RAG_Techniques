    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Reranking is a crucial step in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that aims to improve the relevance and quality of retrieved documents. It involves reassessing and reordering initially retrieved documents to ensure that the most pertinent information is prioritized for subsequent processing or presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The primary motivation for reranking in RAG systems is to overcome limitations of initial retrieval methods, which often rely on simpler similarity metrics. Reranking allows for more sophisticated relevance assessment, taking into account nuanced relationships between queries and documents that might be missed by traditional retrieval techniques. This process aims to enhance the overall performance of RAG systems by ensuring that the most relevant information is used in the generation phase.\n",
