    "### Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System for CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "###### This code implements a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for processing and querying csv documents. The system encodes the document content into a vector store, which can then be queried to retrieve relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSV File Structure and Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The csv file contains dummy customer data, compprising avrious attributes like first name, lastname, company, etc. This data will be utilized for a RAG use case,facilitating te creation of a customer information Q&A system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 1. Loading and splitting csv files\n",
    "###### 2. Vector store creation using FAISS nd OpenAI embeddings\n",
    "###### 3. Retriever setup for querying the processed documents\n",
    "###### 4. Creating a question and answer over the csv data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 1. The csv is loaded using langchain Csvloader\n",
    "###### 2. The data is split into chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector store creation\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 1. OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representation of the text chunks.\n",
    "###### 2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient imilarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retriever Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 1. A retriever is onfigured to fetch the most relevant chunks for a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of this Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 1. Scalability: Can handle large documents by processing them in chunks.\n",
    "###### 2. Flexibility: Easy to adjust parameters like chunk size and number of retrieved results.\n",
    "###### 3. Efficiency: Utilizes FAISS for fast similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "###### 4. Integartion with Advanced NLP: Uses OpenAI embeddings for state-of-the-art text representation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "###### This simple RAG system provides a solid foundation for building more complex information retrieval nd question-answering sytems.\n",
